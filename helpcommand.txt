MM 
MM(MEMORY MODIFY)is used to display memory and,	as required, modify 
data or enter new data. The size (byte, word, long word) controls the 
number of bytes displayed for each address.
MS
The MS (Memory Set) command alters memmory by setting data into the
address specified. The data can take the form of ASCII string or
hexadecimal data.
BF
The Block Fill (BF) command fills memory starting with the word
boundary <address1> through <address2>. Both <address1> and <address2> must
be even	addresses. This command only fills with a word-size (2 bytes) data
pattern. If an entire word-size data pattern is not entered, the pattern is 
right justified and leading zeros are inserted.
BMOV
The Block Move (BMOV) command is used to move (duplicate) blocks of 
memory from one area to another.
BTST
The Block Test (BT) command is a destructive test of a block of 
memory beginning at <address1> through <address2>. If this test
runs to completio without detecting errors, and display a message
that no error was detected. If memory problems are found, a message is
displayed indicating	the address, the data stored, and the data read
of the failing memory.
BSCH
The BSCH (Block	Search)	command	is used	to search a literal string in
a memory block starting at <address1> through <address2> both inclusive.
In BSCH command, if search finds matching data, the data and address(es)
must be displayed.
GO
The GO command is used to start execution from a given address.
DF
The Display Formatted Registers	(DF) command is	used to	display	
the MC68000 processor registers. This command should display current
PC, SR,	US, SS and D, A	registers.
EXIT
The EXIT command terminates/exits your MONITOR program
